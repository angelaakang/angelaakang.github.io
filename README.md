## Projects

## [WE GAUCHO FOOD (javascript)](https://we-gaucho-food.web.app/)
- This was my project for the 2024 ucsb hackathon. I worked on the front end of this project. I used javascript to design the website and add hyperlinks to our project. I had no knowledge of javascript prior to doing this project, but within a span of 48 hours, I was able to quickly learn a little about javascript and design the front end of this website.

## [Diamond Price Prediction (python)](https://github.com/angelaakang/Diamond-Price-Prediction)
- The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the prices of diamonds based on their characteristics. By analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns and relationships, the model will be able to predict the prices of unseen diamonds as well.
